# Future Work and Initiatives

## Overview

This folder contains ongoing and proposed initiatives aimed at improving HAAG’s operational workflows and research progress tracking. The initiatives are developed collaboratively with students from the CS-8803 Course on Management & Leadership in CS, who propose new initiatives that are then added to this repository. 

Each initiative is documented as a standalone file, outlining purpose, workflow, pilot design, and evaluation strategy.

## Current Initiatives

1. **Structured Blocker Escalation Protocol**  
   Focuses on improving early detection and resolution of blocked tasks within the *R for Evolution* team by establishing a lightweight, structured escalation workflow.

2. **Weekly Reporting Workflow Clarification**  
   Consolidates the weekly reporting process into a single procedural reference, improving clarity, transparency, and adherence without introducing new rules or tools.
