# Weekly Reporting Workflow Clarification Initiative

## Purpose

This initiative reviews the current weekly reporting process within HAAG and consolidates it into a single procedural reference to improve clarity and consistency.

While a reporting template and submission deadlines are established, the end-to-end workflow connecting report submission, PM tracking, and admin review is not documented in a single location. Expectations are often communicated through announcements and Slack interactions rather than through one structured procedural reference.


---

## Operational Environment

The weekly reporting process currently includes the following components:

* Researchers submit weekly reports in their project Slack channel by Friday at 5PM ET.
* PM review submissions and synthesize information into the Operations Tracker.
* Tracker info is surfaced in a Master Manager Excel file.
* Administrative leadership may then reference this file for organizational visibility.

While these steps occur in practice, the responsibility chain connecting them is not consolidated in one procedural document.

---

## Observations from Initial Review

Initial discovery indicate the following patterns:

1. Workflow expectations are understood socially rather than through a centralized procedural doc.
2. Responsibility boundaries are sometimes clarified verbally in meetings or textually through Slack.
3. No single doc maps the reporting process from submission to administrative visibility.
4. Reporting compliance appears to rely on reinforcement rather than structural transparency.

These observations suggest an opportunity to improve clarity without altering existing reporting requirements.

---

## Current Reporting Sequence

Based on observation and documentation review, the reporting sequence functions as follows:

1. Researchers prepare weekly report.
2. Researchers post report in the designated Slack project channel before the deadline.
3. PM reviews the report content.
4. Project manager updates the Operations Tracker with relevant progress information.
5. Tracker data is incorporated into the Manager_Master_Excel file.
6. Administrative leadership may reference the consolidated tracker for oversight.

Each step is performed, but the complete sequence and accountability chain are not consolidated into one procedural reference.

## Consolidated Reporting Protocol

This initiative introduces a structured clarification doc that includes:

* Clear submission deadline and location requirements.
* Explicit description of what constitutes proof of work.
* Defined PM responsibility for tracker updates
* Explanation of how tracker entries become visible at the admin-level.
* Clarification of what occurs if a weekly report is missing.

The protocol does not introduce new rules or tools. It consolidates existing expectations to improve transparency.

---

## Working Hypothesis

If the weekly reporting work-flow/accountability chain are consolidated into a single, explicit clarification protocol, then the researchers will demonstrate improved procedural understanding and more consistent adherence to reporting expectations.

---

## Pilot Design

The initiative will be tested within a small cohort during a short observation window.

**Phase 1: Baseline Observation**
* Observe two weeks of reporting under current documentation conditions.
* Record adherence indicators.

**Phase 2: Protocol Intro**
* Share the consolidated clarification protocol with participating researchers.
* Allow two weeks of reporting under clarified conditions.

---

## Measurement Criteria

Two indicators will be used to evaluate impact.

1. Reporting Adherence
   * On time submission
   * Submission in correct Slack channel
   * Inclusion of required proof elements
2. Procedural Understanding
   * Single survey item rated on a five point scale

Baseline and post protocol results will be compared descriptively.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

The initiative will be considered directionally effective if:

* On time submission consistency improves or remains stable while clarity scores increase.
* Researchers report greater awareness of downstream tracking processes.
* PM reports fewer clarification questions regarding reporting expectations.

---

## Scope Boundaries

This initiative does not:
* Modify deadlines.
* Change reporting format.
* Redesign tracking structure.
