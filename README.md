# HAAG Progress Tracking System - Master Readme

## Human-Augmented Analytics Group (HAAG)

### Overview

This repository documents the design, implementation, and operational workflow of the **HAAG Progress Tracking System**, a lightweight, scalable framework for monitoring researcher contributions, team progress, and publication readiness across distributed computational research teams.

It integrates existing research workflows (Slack, GitHub, weekly reports) with structured advisor evaluations and automated notifications to provide **transparent, fair, and timely visibility into project performance**.

## Folder Summaries

### 1. `weekly_reports_history`
Contains historical weekly reports submitted by student researchers. Includes the `different_versions_of_reports` folder with example reports from multiple semesters.

### 2. `weekly_reports_advisors_survey`
Documents the structure and usage of weekly advisor surveys, including submission process, evaluation fields, and automated notifications.

### 3. `github_progress_bot`
Houses the automated progress tracking bot, which monitors GitHub milestones and issues, providing dashboards and Slack notifications for leadership and project managers.

### 4. `website_usage`
Contains documentation on HAAG website history, governance challenges, proposed maintenance procedures, and GitHub-first website update workflows.

### 5. `future_work_and_initiatives`
Stores ongoing and proposed initiatives to improve operational workflows. Currently includes:
- **Structured Blocker Escalation Protocol**
- **Weekly Reporting Workflow Clarification**
- **GitHub-First Website Automation and Content Governance Initiative**

New initiatives may be added collaboratively with students and HAAG team members.

### 6. `milestones_and_larger_themes`
Contains documentation that organizes project progress into concrete milestones and cross-project strategic themes. This folder is intended to support planning, status communication, and alignment between day-to-day tasks and broader research goals.

## Progress Evaluation Model

### Individual Contribution Evaluation

* Good
* Needs Improvement
* Poor

### Team Progress Evaluation

* On Track
* Needs Improvement
* Blocked

This dual-layer evaluation provides both individual and team-level visibility.

---

## Outcomes and Benefits

* Improved visibility and continuous progress tracking
* Standardized reporting and structured advisor feedback
* Early detection of blockers
* Fair and objective evaluation across teams
* Administrative efficiency through integration into existing workflows

---

## Future Work

* LLM-based automated report summaries
* Real-time dashboards
* GitHub activity integration
* Automated compliance tracking
* Cross-project performance analytics
