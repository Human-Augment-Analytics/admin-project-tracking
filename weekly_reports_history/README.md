# History of the HAAG Weekly Reports  
**Last Update:** 03/01/2026  

This document preserves the history of how HAAG Researchers have been asked to submit weekly reports.

## Sample Reports

Redacted sample weekly reports from previous semesters are provided for reference. All identifying information, including student names, email addresses, and identifying details within images or screenshots, has been removed.

The reports are available in the **different_versions_of_reports** folder.

## Semester 1 — May 2024 (Initial Semester)

The Time Log channel in Slack was introduced as the central hub for researcher accountability and communication. With approximately 15 researchers in HACC at the time, the channel served four primary purposes.

### Weekly Check-In Posts

Each researcher posted in the channel to answer three recurring questions:

- What progress did you make in the last week?
- What are you going to work on next?
- Is anything blocking your work?

### Weekly Reports

A structured weekly report was required by 5:00 PM Eastern time every Friday. The report included:

- Summaries of three papers read that week  
  - AI tools like Explain Paper were encouraged to aid comprehension  
- Links to code uploaded to GitHub  
  - Flowcharts and testing status for each script  
- Documentation written in the style of a Methods section  
- Script validation evidence  
  - Screenshots or video recordings showing the code working as intended  
- Results visualizations in the form of figures  
- A proposal for the following week's work  

### Availability Notifications

Researchers were asked to notify the channel when they would be unavailable, without being required to share the reason. Team members and instructors could then plan accordingly. Instructors reserved the right to intervene if a pattern of unavailability was harming a team.

### Positive Recognition

The channel was also used to publicly recognize strong researcher performance, which helped build group morale and provided concrete examples of high-quality work.

### Feedback & Observations

- Transparency across the group was high due to the small cohort size.  
- Requiring three paper summaries per week was viewed as burdensome and detracted from project progress.  
- The level of detail in code and documentation sections varied widely.  
- Some researchers deviated from the standard Word document format in favor of more elaborate formats, which were generally viewed as more comprehensive.

## Semester 2 — Fall 2024

By the second semester, the researcher population had doubled to approximately 30, increasing the volume of submissions in the Time Log channel. The core structure of the weekly report was retained with two notable changes.

### Changes Introduced

- The paper reading requirement was reduced from three articles per week to one.  
- The scripting, flowchart, documentation, and results visualization sections remained unchanged.

### Addition of “Proof of Work”

A new section titled **Proof of Work** was added above the next-week proposal.

This section was intentionally open-ended, allowing researchers to demonstrate — in whatever form they chose — that the work described had actually been completed. The intent was to make the weekly report more self-contained, so a reviewer could assess progress without navigating external links, opening datasets, or running scripts.

### Feedback & Observations

A recurring challenge emerged:

- Researchers often completed their work.  
- However, they were less skilled at demonstrating it in a structured, reviewable way.  
- Simply stating that work was done was common.  
- Showing it through documentation, images, or recordings was less consistent.

## Semester 3 — Spring 2025

Continued feedback that reports required too much time prompted a significant simplification of the weekly report format.

### Structural Changes

The check-in questions previously posted separately in the channel were formally integrated into the report document:

- What did you do this week?
- What are you going to do next week?
- What are your blockers?

Additional changes included:

- The abstract section was retained at one paper per week.  
- The previously separate sections for scripting, documentation, validation, and results visualization were collapsed into a single section asking researchers to describe what they did and provide proof.

### Impact

- The time burden was reduced.  
- Variability increased in how researchers demonstrated their work.  
- The removal of explicit figure-generation requirements was noted as a potential drawback for researchers preparing for manuscript writing.

### Additional Developments

- Publication Preparation Documents were introduced and submitted through the Time Log channel.  
- These documents were designed to guide researchers toward manuscript readiness and are covered in a separate guide.  
- The researcher population grew to approximately 50.  
- The Comp Advisor program was introduced.

## Semester 4 — Summer 2025

No changes were made to the content of the weekly report.

### Platform Shift

Reports were submitted via Basecamp, a formal project management tool, rather than through the Slack Time Log channel.

- Comp Advisors were given segmented access within Basecamp.  
- This enabled more structured project management across research teams.

### Additional Structural Changes

- The Time Log channel gained an additional use: submission of meeting summaries.  
- A Meeting Manager role was assigned within each project team.  
  - The Meeting Manager recorded the date of each meeting, the attendees, and a summary of the discussion.  
- Meeting summaries were also tracked using the wiki.  
- Unit meetings were introduced during this semester.

## Semesters 5 & 6 — Fall 2025 and Spring 2026

No changes were made to the content of the weekly report across these two semesters.

### Continued Platform Migration

**Fall 2025**

- Researchers moved away from Basecamp.  
- Weekly reports were submitted in individual project Slack channels rather than the shared Time Log channel.  
- The Time Log channel continued to be used for meeting summaries.

**Spring 2026**

- Basecamp was fully removed.  
- Researchers continued reporting within their individual project channels.
