# Initiative: Structured Blocker Escalation Protocol for R for Evolution

## Overview

This initiative proposes implementing a **Structured Blocker Escalation Protocol** within the *R for Evolution* team to improve early detection and resolution of blocked work. While weekly reports and advisor check-ins provide visibility into progress, blockers may persist across multiple weeks without structured follow-up.

The proposed experiment introduces a lightweight, standardized method for identifying and responding to blockers within existing weekly reporting workflows. The goal is to reduce stalled work, improve intervention timing, and strengthen overall project momentum.

## Hypothesis

If a structured blocker escalation protocol is implemented within the existing weekly reporting system, then blocked tasks will be identified earlier and resolved more quickly, improving overall team progress and reducing task stagnation.

---

## Organizational Context

This initiative is part of the HAAG tracking working group and focuses specifically on the *R for Evolution* project.

Within HAAG, several procedures related to progress tracking are already in place:

- Weekly student report submissions in project Slack channels  
- Advisor review of weekly reports  
- Completion of a weekly advisor check-in survey  
- Slack bot aggregation of weekly reports (R for Evolution)  
- Informal identification and resolution of blockers during meetings  

Although blockers are already reported within weekly submissions, there is currently no standardized mechanism ensuring repeated blockers trigger structured follow-up.

---

## Discovery and Information Gathering

To understand current practices, information will be collected through:

- Reviewing past weekly reports in the R for Evolution Slack channel  
- Examining advisor survey responses for references to blockers  
- Observing how blockers are discussed during team meetings  
- Conducting brief structured conversations with the project advisor  
- Reviewing Slack bot summaries to identify recurring stalled tasks  

This process will establish how blockers surface, how frequently they persist, and how long they remain unresolved under the current workflow.

---

## Required Resources

Implementation and evaluation of this initiative will rely on:

- Slack message history from the R for Evolution channel  
- Advisor check-in survey responses  
- Slack bot-generated summaries  
- Advisor input and confirmation of workflow practices  
- Existing documentation of the progress tracking system  

---

## Validation Strategy

The protocol will be validated by:

- Confirming that the documented workflow accurately reflects actual team practices  
- Comparing blocker resolution timelines before and after implementation  
- Verifying consistent adherence to the escalation steps across multiple weeks  

---

## Organizational Need

This initiative addresses the need for early, consistent identification and resolution of blockers.

While weekly reporting provides visibility into project progress, delays may persist when blockers are repeatedly reported without structured escalation. The absence of a defined follow-up threshold can lead to extended task stagnation and unclear responsibility for intervention.

The Structured Blocker Escalation Protocol aims to reduce:

- The time a task remains blocked  
- Ambiguity around responsibility for resolution  
- Delayed leadership awareness of stalled work

## Intended Audience

- **Primary:** Advisor of R for Evolution  
- **Secondary:** Student researchers on the team  
- **Tertiary:** HAAG leadership interested in scalable progress tracking mechanisms
